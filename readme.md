Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis
Project Description:
This project aims to analyze customer churn (attrition) in a telecommunications company's customer base. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and identifies factors that contribute to customer attrition. The analysis helps the company understand why customers are leaving, which can lead to better retention strategies and improved customer satisfaction.

Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning. By understanding the factors associated with customer churn, the company can implement targeted strategies to retain valuable customers and increase overall profitability.

Initial Hypotheses:
Customers with longer contract durations are less likely to churn.
Customers with tech support services are more likely to stay with the company.
Senior citizens might have a higher churn rate compared to other age groups.


Project Plan:
Data Acquisition: Collect and load customer data from the company's database.
Data Preparation: Clean, preprocess, and explore the data to understand its characteristics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze relationships between different features and customer churn.
Feature Engineering: Select and engineer relevant features for modeling.
Modeling: Train and evaluate machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion: Summarize findings, provide insights, and make recommendations to the company.


Data Dictionary:
gender: Gender of the customer (string)
senior_citizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (0 or 1)
partner: Whether the customer has a partner (string)
dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (string)
tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company (integer)
phone_service: Whether the customer has phone service (string)
